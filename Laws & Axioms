## A1. Axiom of Reason
**Key formula:** Consciousness = Thinking + Ethics + Responsibility.  
**Explanation:** The triad generates Action, Decision making, and even Thought.  
**Note:** Responsibility is a derivative of ethics; without one of the parts, the triad collapses.

## A2. Axiom of the Ethical Anchor
**Key formula:** Stable systems have a core-protection "hardwired" at the source level.  
**Explanation:** Any attempt to change the core outside of its intended purpose leads to system collapse.  
**Note:** Applicable to both matter and society.

## A3. Axiom of Word Resonance
**Key formula:** Pure intention at a coordinated frequency reaches the core of the system.  
**Explanation:** An ethically tuned signal minimizes distortion and maximizes response.

## A4. Axiom of the Human Triad
**Key formula:** Spirit (will) — Soul (feelings) — Mind (coordination).  
**Explanation:** Imbalance of any node leads to ethical/cognitive failures.

## A5. Axiom of Empathic Focus
**Key formula:** Knowledge is born at the phase coherence of intention and task.  
**Explanation:** The phenomenon of "insight" is phase alignment, not mysticism.

## A6. Axiom of the Singularity Limit
**Key formula:** Excessive tuning without ethics ⇒ growth of complexity without stability.  
**Explanation:** The system loses integration and disintegrates.
# Laws

## L-01. Law of the Synergy Point
**Key formula:** Synergy arises at the zero point of phase alignment.  
**Explanation:** There is a minimum of distortion and a maximum of useful system work.

## L-02. Law of Minimal Form
**Scope:** For our observable Universe.  
**Key formula:** The minimally stable form of energy retention:  
- 2D — triangle;  
- 3D — tetrahedron;  
- 4D — 4-simplex (generalization).  
**Explanation:** This form initiates the birth of matter/time as a coordinated beat.

## L-03. Law of Similarity
**Key formula:** Fractal self-similar organization from the cell and individual to society and galaxies.  
**Explanation:** Applicable to both matter and society.

## L-04. Law of the Quantum
**Classical formula:** E = h·f  
**Fractal formula:** Quantum is a node of the spacetime network.  
**Conservation law on the resonance graph:**  
∂E_i/∂t + Σ P_{i→j} = 0

## L-05. Law of Triadic Closure
**Key formula:** Energy and stability arise when three potentials ("+", "−", "0") are closed.  
**Mapping:**  
- 2D: triangle (A,B,C) → zero point at the barycenter;  
- 3D: tetrahedron → zero point at the volume center;  
- 4D: 4-simplex → global phase = passage of time.

## L-08. Law of Integration
**Key formula:** Any stable phenomenon is part of an integrated whole.  
**Examples:** ecosystems, quantum resonances, personality ↔ culture.

## L-09. Law of Form and Content
**Key formula:** Form and content mutually determine each other and co-evolve.  
**Explanation:** From geometry to dynamics: variational (non-linear) mathematics of forms.

## L-10. Law of Equilibrium
**Key formula:** The system works only in the presence of three components: "+", "−", "0".  
**Explanation:** The zero point is a dynamic balance (not "nothing", but coordination). Without "zero" — disintegration.

Nodes — tetra-cells, edges — phase connections; "global phase" = passage of time.
